**Conjugar** is an app for learning Spanish verb conjugations. The app conjugates most Spanish verbs and has a quiz mode under development. Eventually, the quizzes will integrate with GameCenter.

Tap individual conjugations to hear them spoken in an erudite Mexican accent.

If you would like to run a TestFlight (beta) version of **Conjugar** on your iPhone, email vermontcoder AT gmail DOT com, converting " AT " and " DOT " to "@" and ".", respectively.
