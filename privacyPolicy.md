Privacy Policy
===================

Conjugar uses the Amazon Web Services&trade; analytics product, Pinpoint&trade;, to track certain information. This information consists of:

* Each screen visited
* The act of starting a quiz
* The act of finishing a quiz, with score
* Game Center&trade; authentication
* App version
* Unique installs
* Device type (iPhone or iPad)
* Country of user

Conjugar does _not_ track any personally identifiable user information.

As demonstrated in the following examples, analytics inform future development of Conjugar.

At present, quizzes have fifty verbs. The goal of this length is to present a mix of all tenses for the current difficulty level with a mix of regular and irregular verbs. But if, for example, most users are starting but not finishing quizzes, Conjugar's developer might consider shortening the quiz length.

Conjugar has Game Center&trade; integration. Use of this integration is optional. If most users are not authenticating Game Center&trade;, Conjugar's developer might consider removing the integration.

Please direct any questions about or feedback on this privacy policy to Conjugar's [developer](mailto:vermontcoder@gmail.com).
